rando ideas

* after this simplest version ... the next version could have buttons for sidebar/max/min, etc
* or menu items ... do we accept the defaults now?


** AH YES ... i want to embed this into web pages again.
this code is still on main ITS website lol

* are there settings we could put into a settings.ini file?

	* create window parameters
	* file names?
	* editor names (cmd)
	* icon name.

OLD NOTES ...

* maybe put some first base lingo in here and even unicode chars to test

(from package.json you could sniff out index.js ... then index.html and preload.js)
(or just list things from this directory from python http.server or nodejs on the backend. although that is not the point of this demo)
Code will hot reload. just hardcoding the file list is fine ... because that is the main thing we are trying to demo.

i kind of want to redirect logging from index.cfm to the index.html debugger. especially handy for hot reloads.
